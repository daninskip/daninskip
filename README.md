### Hello. ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for taking a look at my projects.  
A majority of what I have worked on are things I have completed while working towards my Bachelors degree in Computer Science.  
Other projects are from my C# .NET Full-stack bootcamp with Grand Circus.
Getting a start into the Tech industry takes a leap of faith and hope that you can find a company that will give you that initial chance.  


Any questions, comments or suggestions on some good practice, please reach out:

daninskip@hotmail.com

I'm always looking for ways to improve myself and learn new things.

Thanks again for taking a look around.
